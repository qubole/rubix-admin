# Admin Tool for RubiX

**NOTE:** RubiX Admin currently only supports RPM-based Linux distributions.

## Installation

RubiX Admin should be installed on the Presto/Spark/Hadoop2 cluster master node.

### From Source

    git clone https://github.com/qubole/rubix-admin.git
    cd rubix-admin
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    python setup.py install

### From PIP

    pip install rubix-admin

## Configuration
RubiX Admin expects a configuration file at `~/.radminrc`. This file can be
generated by running the following command:

    rubix_admin -h

Edit the configuration file to include the worker node IPs.

    coordinator:
      - localhost
    workers:
      - <worker-ip1>
      - <worker-ip2>
      ..
    remote_packages_path: /tmp/rubix_rpms

## Install RubiX

To install the latest version of RubiX:

    rubix_admin installer install --cluster-type {presto,spark}

To install RubiX from an RPM file (which can be generated from the
[Qubole RubiX project](https://github.com/qubole/rubix)):

    rubix_admin installer install --cluster-type {presto,spark} --rpm <path to RubiX rpm>

## Start RubiX

    rubix_admin daemon start

You can verify that the BookKeeperServer and LocalDataTransferServer daemons
have started by running ``sudo jps -m`` on each node in cluster.
